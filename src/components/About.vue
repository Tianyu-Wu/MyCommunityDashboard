During the Corona situation, people now spend most of their time at home and hang around mostly close to the community. Therefore, it may be interesting to create a responsive web app that can inform users about the weather and air conditions about their community. With this regard, I decided to define my neighbourhood (i.e. Kreis Seebach) as my primary study area. As the app aim to provide users with detailed measurement of temperature, PM 2.5, and PM 10 in different timeframe, a dashboard is a good option for a concise and effective visualization. ",
